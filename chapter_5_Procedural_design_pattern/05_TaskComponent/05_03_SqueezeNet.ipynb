    "You can see that instead of a dense layer, it uses a 1 × 1 convolution, in which the number of filters corresponds to the number of classes (C). In this way, the 1 × 1 convolution is learning a probability distribution for the classes instead of a projection of the input feature maps. The resulting (C) feature maps are then each reduced into a single real value for the probability distribution and flattened into a 1D output vector. For example, if each feature map outputted by the 1 × 1 convolution is 3 × 3 in size (9 pixels), the pixel with the highest value is chosen as the probability for the corresponding class. The 1D vector is then squashed by a softmax activation so all the probabilities add up to 1."
